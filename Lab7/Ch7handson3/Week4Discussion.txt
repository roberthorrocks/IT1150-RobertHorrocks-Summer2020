Color brings it's own intuition. 

How we see color and how it brings life to the visual objects are always a fascinating course of study. 

In a past life, I had to understand color and color mixing during my work for the Xerox company. 

We would study the color wheel, complimentary and conflicting colors, and how to mix using the CMYK and RGB schemes. 

The article helped me to gain a better understanding of the psychology of color. It was interesting to read the balance of positive feeling and psychology with color as well as the flip side feelings of each color. 

As far as web design and how I approach design and development, it is important to use color to match the type of feelings and call to action you are looking your reader or user to see. 

I've always been a minimalist designer in my projects, but I will definitely use color strategically in the future.
