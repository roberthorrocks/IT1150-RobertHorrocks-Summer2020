First, my question- was anyone else having a problem with the article's pictures not rendering in their browser? I tried bothe Chrome and Edge, no luck. 

I actually liked Slack's design the best of those in the article. 

Many of the trends were on sites of professional web designers. Because their site is basically their portfolio home page, they have to include elements that may be "trendy" but I find distracting. 

I can't blame them for including them in their website though, they need to be on the cutting edge. As students of web design, it is good to see the ideas and see what is possible in web design and style. 

But I liked Slack because it had a simple white background, a clean logo, a call to action on the first view without scrolling, a video, a demo, case studies and major clients providing a testimonial to their work. 

They also used scrolling and changing elements to encourage click-through. It represented the best of what a tech company website should be.
